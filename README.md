#### About me
- 📈📊 I have experience developing data analysis, NLP and financial analysis tools.
- 🖥🌐 I have web development experience both in the Backend and the Frontend.
-

- 👀 I am interested in backend, frontend and data analysis roles in London, UK.


>  ### *I’m passionate about building tools that solve day-to-day problems for people. Having worked in a large multinational, I know how much time people spend doing painfully repetitive tasks. This is a travesty! People are a critical resource and we shouldn't be spending their valuable efforts on tasks that don't give them the opportunity to grow. I enjoy the process of breaking seemingly complex problems down into smaller problems, solving them and then delivering solutions to end-users.*

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fastai course to build my skills in NLP/Machine Learning.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate! I want to grow as a developer, and I will jump at any opportunity to expand my skills.
