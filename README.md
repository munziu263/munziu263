# 👋 Hi, I’m Munatsi Ziumbe
## 💻 I'm a Junior Software Developer with experience as a paid contractor, looking for a full time role.

#### About me
- 📈📊 I have experience developing tools for data analysis.
- 🐍 I work in Python and Typescript, but I am currently looking for excuses to spend more time in Scala, C++, and Golang.
- 👀 I am interested in backend and fullstack roles in London, UK and Barcelona, Spain


> I’m passionate about building tools that solve day-to-day problems for people. Having worked in a large multinational, I know how much time people spend doing painfully repetitive and menial tasks. This is a travesty! People are a critical resource and we shouldn't be wasting their time on tasks that don't challenge them mentally. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scala.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate! I want to grow as a developer, and I will jump at any opportunity to expand my skills.
